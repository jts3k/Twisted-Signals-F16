*COURSE DESCRIPTION*

This course presents an overview on manipulating and synthesizing sound, video, and control signals. Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art and design - electronic music, interactive art, video art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond.

In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a. Max/MSP/Jitter). We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques. Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks.

ASSIGNMENTS

There are 6 short-term assignments that will be completed over the course of the semester as well as one Final Project. Due dates for every assignment are listed [on the course calendar](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/18-090/f2016/calendar/). Assignments are due before the start of the class on the date indicated.

Submission of assignments is a two step process.

1. The student creates a post on the course website with documentation of the work. This will include code, video documentation, and audio documentation. For details on the proper formatting of documentation see [this page](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/18-090/f2016/2016/08/16/posting-to-the-site/). Documentation that is improperly formatted will be considered unacceptable.

2. The student [turns in the assignment using Blackboard ](http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard/gettingstarted/#gettingstarted/assignments)by pasting a link to your post in the "Text Submission" area.

Assignments that are delivered late will be penalized. See the grading section of the syllabus for further details.

Additionally students are expected to author one post each week on the class website in the "Gallery" section. This can be any piece of electronic art or design that you find interesting. Your post can simply be a link to a youtube video or external site, or it can be a more descriptive article that you write. This should be done by the end of the day on Fridays so we can read the posts over the weekend and discuss them on Monday.

QUOTE-UNQUOTE EXAMS

There will be two "exams." The word “exam” is quotation marks because these are not worth a lot of points towards your final grade. The dates for the quote-unquote Midterm Exam and quote-unquote Final Exam are [on the course calendar](http://jessestil.es/teaching/fall2015-DMI/calendar/).

SOFTWARE

The majority of the work we do in class will be done in Max, a graphical programming environment that is optimized for artists, musicians, and other creative practitioners. For access to the software you have three options:

You may work on the Mac Pro that is permanently installed in the Media Lab. Select the "Media Lab User" user account. When you are using this account create a folder with your Andrew ID and store all your files in this folder. It is very important that you back up your work every time you work on the computer. It is entirely possible that files on a communally used machine can be unexpectedly moved, erased, or modified. Get an external drive (physical or in the cloud) and back up your work constantly.

You may also work on any of the 40 MacBook Pro laptops that are available to you in the IDeATe storage room. Similarly, you must be diligent in backing up your work when using these machines. The laptops and the Mac Pro all have Max 7, Logic Pro, Audacity, Arduino, Final Cut, Photoshop, Illustrator, and many other useful pieces of software.

Thirdly, you may work on your own computer. A one-year license of Max is available for $59. If you work on your own computer you will be responsible for acquiring and maintaining any of the software you choose to use. Your instructor cannot provide technical support on your computer for you.

Max is available from Cycling 74 at:

EQUIPMENT

There is a wide variety of sound, video, and photo equipment available to you from the IDeATe storage room. The Media Lab is also packed to the gills with powerful audio/video equipment. Your participation in the course makes all of this equipment available to you throughout the semester (and in the future, if you pay a minimal "Membership Fee.")

We are able to afford these many fine instruments because we are a large community, working together. To be a part of this community you must respect communally used equipment, and take excellent care of it. If you damage equipment due to careless behavior the cost of repairs will be charged to your student account.

USING THE MEDIA LAB

You will have access to the Media Lab outside of class hours - it is an excellent environment for you to work on your projects. To use the Media Lab outside of class time you must [make a reservation using the online reservation system](http://ideate.andrew.cmu.edu/reservations/day.php?area=5). When using the Media Lab outside of class you must comply with the [policies indicated on the class website](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/18-090/f2016/2016/08/16/media-lab-policies/).

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

When we are designing new software it is perfectly acceptable to use sections of code from examples found on the web, in help files, in tutorials, etc. Indeed, this is not only acceptable but is totally necessary if one wants to work efficiently.

Furthermore, when we are creating new works of electronic art is perfectly acceptable to make use of found materials (video files, sound files, images, etc.) to use as raw material in creating new works of art/music/design.

When using found code/images/sounds in your own work there are two requirements:

1. **Attribution**. You must clearly identify where the code/images/sound came from.

2. **Transformation**. You must *significantly transform* the materials you are using. You should extend the material, modify it into something new, offer new insight into the concepts underlying the material, etc. Work that uses borrowed code or other materials without significantly transforming those materials will result in a low grade.

ATTENDANCE &amp; CLASS PARTICIPATION

Attendance: Unexcused absences are disruptive and disrespectful. If you are unable to attend class for any reason you must email me in advance. Failure to contact me before the start of class will result in an unexcused absence. Three or more unexcused absences will result in the drop of one letter grade per absence. This means that if you have three unexcused absences and would otherwise receive an A in the class, you will receive a B. If you have four unexcused absences and would otherwise receive an A, you will receive a C, etc.

Absences: You are responsible for what happens in class whether you’re here or not. Organize with your classmates to get class information and material that you have missed. We cannot repeat course material in class just for you.

Participation: You are invited, encouraged, and expected to engage actively in discussion, reflection and activities. Our class time is precious and limited. Please refrain from texting, facebooking, tweeting, etc., during class time - this behavior during class is distracting, disruptive, and disrespectful. Failure to follow this request will negatively affect your grade for class participation. Your contributions towards the class website will also count towards your class participation.

GRADING

Grading for the course is based on the assignments, exams, and class participation. Each of the short-term assignment will graded on a scale from 0 to 4 points. Of these 4 points, 2 shall be awarded to the quality and originality of the concept in the work. Another 2 points shall be awarded to the quality of the technical execution of the work. For both criteria, concept and execution, the determination shall be made accordingly:

0: Incomplete. For example: the code does not work, the work does neet address the goal of the assignment, the work was not delivered on-time.

1: Satisfactory. The work was delivered on time and addresses the goal of the assignment.

2: Excellent. The work demonstrates an outstanding concept or execution. The work demonstrates great insight.

Your Final Project will be evaluated in the same way, but will be worth a total of 8 points. So, the same as above, multiplied by two.

Work that is delivered late will automatically have 1 point deducted from the potential 4 point score. A further point shall be deducted for every 48 hours of lateness. For example: 1-2 days late = maximum score of 3 points. 3-4 days late = maximum score of 2 points. 5-6 days late = maximum score of 1 point. 7+ days late = 0 points.

Each of the exams will be worth 4 points.

Class participation will be worth 10 points. This includes your participation in discussions and activities during class-time, as well as your participation on the class website (authoring weekly posts in the gallery, authoring high-quality documentation of your own work, and commenting on posts authored by your classmates and instructor).

Short term assignments: 6 x 4 = 24 points

Final project: 8 points

Exams: 2 x 4 = 8 points

Class participation: 10 points

Total: 50 points

Your final grade will be determined by multiplying the total by two and applying a curve, if appropriate.
